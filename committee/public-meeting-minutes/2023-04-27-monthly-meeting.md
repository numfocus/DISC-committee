## Discussions

* After some discussion, we would like to reach out on slack to get the following suggestions shared with the group:
    - Ask DISC committee for their timezone availability so we can plan for either one or two alternating timeslots that would cover most timezones.
    - Discuss possible improvements/flexibilization of quorum procedures, including potentially having async votes on the slack channel so that we can have the meetings and discuss topics even if we don‚Äôt reach quorum.
    - Discuss the possibility of having some record of attendance and participation on the committee, so that members know their responsibilities and we can move forward with decisions.
    - https://github.com/numfocus/DISC-committee/tree/main/committee
    Voting process is not specified in our charter https://github.com/numfocus/DISC-committee/blob/main/committee/DISC-Committee-Charter-2021.pdf 
    - Quorum: simple majority - only for decision-making but not for meeting (need to make this explicit in our charter, we have 8 people in our committee)
    - We will keep this slot for regular meetings - 7pm BST/8pm CET/11 am PDT
    - Follow up: Rachel and Katrina (are they going to keep participating)
        + Melissa - Outreach to Rachel
        + Arliss - Outreach to Katrina and associated followup on the response.
    - Amendments to the charter re attendance and affiliation: (working doc for suggestions)
        + Also document the process to remove folks from the committee 
        + Attendance: options could be percentage of votes / meetings (6 meetings feels too long)
        + Voting: 
            * Sync: if we do find a sweet slot for majority attendance keep simple majority
            * Async: share discussion + proposal, allow for async questions and discussions, set voting date and require unanimous vote. If there is no consensus then this is passed onto a sync vote on the next meeting. The idea being that a higher bar be set for async votes so that decisions that have disagreement are better discussed synchronously. 

### Notes:
* A few meetings difficult to reach quorum, difficult to schedule times for everyone to meet
* Should we alternate, or have 2 meetings
* Do we have a charter or protocol how we handle votes, meetings, etc., see charter: https://github.com/numfocus/DISC-committee/blob/main/committee/DISC-Committee-Charter-2021.pdf 
* 18:00 UTC works for current attendies, continue to meet at this time or continue debate
* DISC Unconference: still looking at locking up dates and venues (Gayle is busy with JupyterCon atm). Arliss will look at checking in with the venue for PyData Amsterdam (week of 18th - 22nd September 2023) or Project Summit is another event that it could be co-located with but planning timelines may not line up (they‚Äôre not ready to announce dates). No final dates have been selected as of today.
    - Rationale: we would have some NF staff already 
    - Who from the committee would like to participate: Melissa, Noa (they will be in Amsterdam already), Tania, Ana, Mariana
    - Cookbook: pushed live and added a blurb in the NumFOCUS newsletter

### AR‚Äôs:
* Make a record of attendance to past meetings from the meeting minutes (Mark)
* Get async voting language if it exists from Affiliated Project Selection Committee charter. (Mark)

### TODO:
- [ ] Tania to type up the charter changes and circulate them for asynchronous vote
- [ ] Tania to draft something around attendance (requirements) and processes to remove folks that do not meet the attendance requirements
